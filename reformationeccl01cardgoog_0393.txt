handwriting‚ with the exception os some verbal alterations
from the pen oi Dr. Haddon, a lew corrections in an un-
known hand, and some notes and a table of contenta
inserted afterwards by J ohn Foxe the martyrologist.

In this appendix then are recorded two kinds οἰ different
readings3 the alterations made on the lace of the MS. by
arohbishop Oranmer and Peter Martyr, and the deviatione
from the so altered MS, which were made on the aa·
thority ol archbishop Parlrer in the edition ol 1571. The
alterations made by Haddon, being merely matters of
idiom and interpretation, are not notieed.

The MS.‚ as has already been stated iu the presses, does
not comprise the sections contained in pp. 70-80‚ and
pp. 156-177. It has two tables of contents, giving the

titles oi the sections merely, the first in the writing of
archbishop Cranmm, except the titles De dilapid. De alien.
De elect. De testam, aud those of the eight absent see·
tions, which titles were added by Foxe; and the second
having all the tides, but arranged in a different order, in
the writing os Foxe. The latter table is headed thus :—

-18. sint MS. sunt
