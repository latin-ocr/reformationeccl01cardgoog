cution of the work to the archbishop‚ Peter Martyr
and six others, all of them to be members of the
greater commission‚ which would be appointed
afterwards. We may infer from some changes
made in the commissionem, and still more from
the evidence afforded by our MS, that the arch-
bishop and Martyr took the whole responsibility
upon themselves, employing Dr. Haddone to see
that their sentimenta were expressed in proper

language.

lily, Exeter, Gloucester, Beth, Rochester. Divines; Mr. Taylor
of Lincoln, Cox Almoner, Parker of Cambridge, Latimer, Cook
(sir Anthony, Ι suppose), Peter Martyr, Cheke, J oannes a Lasco.
Civilicnsr Mr. Peter, Cecyl, sir Thomas Smirh, Taylor of Had-
leigh, Dr. May. Mr'l'raheron, Dr. Lyel, Mr. Skinner. Lawyers;
justice Hales, justice Bromley‚ Goodrick, Gosnal, stamford,
Carel, Lucas, Brook recorder of London. It was so ordered
that this number should be divided into four distinct classes or
compauies; each to consist of two bishops, two divines, two
civilians, and two common lawyers. And to each company were
assigned their set parts; which when one company had finished,
it was transmitted to the other companies, to be by them all
well considered and inspected. But out of all the number oi

thirty-two eight especially were selected, from each rank two;
viz. out of the bishops the archbishop and the bishop of lily, out

oi the divines Cox and Martyr‚ out of the civilians Taylor and
Moy. out of the common lawyers Lucas and Goodrick: to
whom a new commission was made November9[11] for the
first forming of the work and preparation oi the matter.'' This
statement appears to be incorrectae it is plain from the lan-
gnage of the November commission (see hereaiter, p. xxx.) that
the greater number of thirty-four hod not yet been appointed
when that commission was issued.

⁰ lhere are also a few ceses of words written in an unknown
hand, aud two instances where the abp. has written in the margin
at the head osa section, “For Mr. Mortes.'¹ This is probably
the person mentioned by Poxe and Strype as the abp's secretary.
