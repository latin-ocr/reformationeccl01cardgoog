PREFACE, 1850. xi

same year when the XXXIX Articles of Religion
were finally subscribed by convocation and rati-
fied by parliament and represents the state and
condition 01 150 Church of England in the reign
01 queen Elizabeth when the reformation may
50 said 10 have been eompleted.

But this MS. is not known 10 50 10 existence.
-It was placed in the hands of Foxe‚ was pro-
bably delivered 10 0 scribe that a transcript
might be taken for the 000 01 150 compositor in
1571, and cannot 50 traced further. Had it been
returned 10 Foxe‚ it would probably have passed
into the Harleian collection, together with the
MS. 01 abp. Cranmer3 had it been restored 10
abp. Parker‚ it would doubtless have been de·
posited together with his other papers 10 150
Parker libraryb at Cambridge.

But the edition 011571, for which Foxe pro-

vided 0 0101000, making himself responsible for
the aecuracy 01 150 whole work, might be 00-
sumed to be identieal with the MS. from which

it was printed, and so supply the place 01150
missing document. 11 does not indeed appear
to have been adopted by the queen and her
government‚ but 11 was published, as Foxe in-

11100, 50 was not employed and directed by him. Had it been
οο, Foxe would have made come reference to the 1001 10 510 pre-
1000, end would heve absteined from certain observatione on the
Book 01 Common Pmyer, which he might be well assured the
urehbirhop would not have approved.

¹¹ In that library there is aeopy of the edition 01 1571, 501 11
does 0010001010 any MS. 0010 or correction from the arehbishop‚
although he lived several years efter its publication.
