produced by Mr.Norton, eminent debaters of that
period, during a discussion on religious subjecta
in the house of commons, was referred, together
with other matters of a similar nature, to a com-,
mittce of that house, and was ordered to be
translated into English ¹⁴. But it made no prol
gress. The queen, averse ,to all interference of
the commons in ecclesiastioal matters, had con·
ceived an especial displeasure against the indi-
viduals by whom the measure was recommend-

examination of the book itself sufficient reasons
for delaying the consideration of it to a future
period. There is no notice of it in the Journals
of either bouse; and so little does the queen¹
appear either to have approved of the book, or
to have been in favour of the general measure,
that no attempt apparently was mide during

her reign to revive the act of 1549112.

sect in his tract ⁴· Reformation no enemy'' &a 1590. On the same
principle the copy of the XXXIX Articles enacted in the same
year 1571. was of the English version, printed by Jugge and
Cawood in the year 1563. Synodalia. voli. p. 59.

¹ The speech, in which Mr. Strickland noticed the book, cou-
tained some severe observatione on the Book os Common Prayer
and the abuses of the Church, to which Mr. Norton assented;
and the prelace by which Foxe seeks to recommend the book
calls sor further reformation in the Book ol Common Prayer.

¹¹¹ The book appears to have had little circulation. Mr. Strick.
