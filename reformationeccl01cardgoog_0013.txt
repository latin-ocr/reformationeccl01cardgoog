iv PREFACE, 1850.

And now in the present parliament, so active for '
the reforming of religion, it was moved, as was
thought, sessonably. And care was taken to ³
have it printed against the sitting 61 the parlia-

ment: which was done by John Fon, from two
original MS. copies: the former archbishop Cran-
mer’s own book (which afterwards 1611 11116 Fox’s
possession); wherein was much 61 his own hand,
as likewise 61 Ρ6161 Martyr’s and other the assist
ants: the other a copy belonging to archbishop
Parker. Who, Ι verily believe, employed and
encouraged Fox in preparing this book 161 1116
press. And that he made use 61 6111 archbishop‘s
copy, appears by what Fox wrote in his own
on the head 61 the page that contains the titles
of the whole following book, viz. Ordo titulo-
rum in 061. D. Matth. Cant. placing those titles
according to the said archbishop’s copy com-
municated to him.

“April 6. Μ1. Ν611611, a stirring member 61 the
house, (charactered ‘a wise and bold man aud elo-
quent’) in a speech there mentioned this book,
and propounded that consideration should be had
61 11; and that Mr. Fox had taken pains about it
and printed it, Norton then and there producing
it. And a committee was thereupon appointed
161 redross 61 sundry defects in religion. But
instead 61 reviewing and furthering the establish-
ment 61 this excellent and elaborate book, the
parliament fell rather upon examining other
matters 61 religion already established, which
gave the queen great offence.
