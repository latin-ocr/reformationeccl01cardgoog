MS. 01 archbishop Oranmer, which is still extant,
we find a second table 01 contents in a corrected
form professing to be taken 110111 the MS. 01

archbishop Parker, and headed by the following
words in Foxe's handwriting: “Ordo titulorum
in Codice Ι).· Matt. Cant.”

The MS. 01 abp. Cranmer appears to have con·
tinned in the possession 01 Foxe until his death,
and at a subsequent period was transferred
among other papers belonging to him to the
library 01 the earl· 01 Oxford. It is now preserved
together with the rest 01 the Harleian collection
in the British Museum.

This MS. possesses a singular degree 01 in-
terest. Having been written out with great care,
it was submitted to the archbishop 101· a last re-
vision, and contains together with various supple-
ments and suggestions 01 Peter Martyr and Dr.
Haddon in their handwriting the final additions
and alterations 01 abp. Oranmer written hy him-
self. It had now reached so great a degree of
completeness, having had many 01 its clerical
errors corrected and titles supplied 101 all the
separate chapters, partly from the pen 01 the
archbishop and partly from that 01 Peter Martyr,
that atter one further examinatior from the
archbishop 10 dispose 01 the observations made
by Martyr and Haddon‚ it might be presented to
the king, and receive the final ratifications pre-
scribed by the act 01 parliament, under which
the whole work was undertaken.

An act had been passed in the year 1549 em·
