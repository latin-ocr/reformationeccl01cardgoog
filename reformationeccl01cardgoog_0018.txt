11 would appear then that they were engaged
in this work during the year 1552, and that our

MS. 10ογ be considered as the result of their
labours during 11101 period.

Bnt the whole subject, growing upon them
probably as they proceeded, was not yet ex·
hausted. Eight sections 01 itare wanting in our
MS, which 010 essential to the completeness of
the code, and were in fact provided before it was
printed in the year 1571. The archbishop there-
fore and his colleague had not finished their task
before the powers conferred hythe act 01 1549,
and limited to the period of three years, had
expired3 and though we find from the Journals
of the house 01 lords theta bill was introduced
for the renewal of the attend made some pro-

gress in both 1100000, 11 had not passed into 0
law on the 15111 01 April 1552, on which day the
parliament was dissolved‘.

f Strype says (0101111101, 101. i. p. 389) “ the parliament gave
the king three years longer.'' Bp. Burnet says (Η101.011101.
101. 11. p. 40 5) ‘⁸ In 11101001 session 01 the parliament they had
three years more time offered them. But this continuation was
not judged necessary.” The Journels 01 the house 01 lords do
not confirm either statement, though they 010 consistent with
the 101101. They shew 11101 the bill was brought up from the ·
house 01 commone, was read 0 first and second time in the house
01 lords 00 the r4th 01 April, the day before the dissolution, and
100110 uo further mention 01 it. We 01ογ perhaps guther 0 differ-
0011011000 101 the non· 0110110100 01 the time 11001 0 101101 written
by Cor, one 01 the commissionem, to Bullinger on the 5th 01
October, 1552, in which he states that though they had been
successful 10 the revision 01 the Liturgy, they had failed in their
endeavours to establish 0 system 01 Christian discipline. See
